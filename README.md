# BDO-Boss-Timer-Discord-Bot-Yuri-Project-
BDO Boss Timer application made using vb.net all it need to work whit discord is Bot Token.
here u can find on how to creat a bot and invite it to ur server and get its Token (https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
the application usage steps are very simple

1.launch 1-Yuri.exe

2.Input Bot Token
 
3.Input the role u want to announce To ex:@everyone or @here or @role what ever role u wish to use

4.click on Save Settings 

5.make sure u have invited the Bot u made to the discord u want to use it in 

6.Click on Connect

7.Go to the Channel u want the Bot to post in and input this command for the bot to start (!$$run)

and that all u have to do u can tweak the settings from the application like changing region and notification timer and u dont need to restart 
the application when u change region u can change it wheil the bot its posting it well take around 6 seconds to update to the new region 

Note:: the Bot uses it resources From (https://mmotimer.com) and how it works it filters the site html code and collect the need it data every 500ms 
and it updates the time on discord every 5 seconds and u really should mute the channel has the bot since it post message every 5 seconds replacing the old 
one, and use the button on topright of the app to send it to Try Hope u all like the project and ty for the support :D
